# Cylcone PCB Mill

I have been making circuit boards using the toner transfer and etching acid method since I was a kid, and I had always despised it. The process was long, messy, and error prone. Since I had gotten my [3d printer](printer.md), I had always wanted to add a Dremel to mill the copper off a circuit board. I acually tried this, and it seemed to work, but I did not have any real bits to use. After this initial sucess, I decided to build a dedicated machine for pcb milling. I did some searching, and found the [Cyclone PCB Factory](https://github.com/CarlosGS/Cyclone-PCB-Factory) on GitHub. It used a Dremel for the spindle, and most of the frame was 3d printed.

  I put together a list of parts, and the total was about $150, including the Dremel.
