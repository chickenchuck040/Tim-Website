I am a **curious** and **technology driven** student.

## About Me

I am a freshman at Rowan University. I am very passionate about technology and am immersed in it every day, always learning more. I started with a Lego Mindstorms NXT, and slowly added Legos to my collection. I have built many robots with the basic kit, as well as many more advanced robots later on. One of the most impressive is my autonomous battlebot, [Java](battlebots.md#java). I had also joined a local 4-H robotics club, [Robostorm](robostorm.md). Through Robostorm, I was able to join a [FIRST Robotics](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team, [3637 The Daleks](daleks.md), at a neighboring high school. Around eighth grade, I started to exhaust the uses of my Legos, and I wanted to move on. At this point, 3d printers started becoming a thing, and I decided that I wanted one. After building the [kit](3dprinter.md), I then made many modifications, such as adding a [touchscreen](3dprinter.md#touchscreen).
